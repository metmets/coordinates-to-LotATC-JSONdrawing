This code converts takes in coordinates of a drawing (in XXXXXXN/S XXXXXXXW/E etc) and converts it into a LotAtc drawing. This code supports multiple layers in one drawing - for drawing different sectors in an airspace.

Simply find the things you want to draw (usually from an AIP), example: 414217N 0450126E - 414340N 0450353E - 413901N 0452757E - 413756N 0452930E - 413701N 0453109E - 413622N 0453301E - 413535N 0454349E - 412122N 0454200E - then along the state border - 412804N 0451543E - 
413110N 0451526E - 414217N 0450126E.
Remove any text ("then along the state border") and any line breaks (there are websites that do that).
Run the code and follow the instructions from there. 

I'm very new to programming so if you think that my code is crap then you're most ~likely~ completely right. At least it works (at least i really really hope).
